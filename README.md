# RustOS - Building a Simple Operating System with Rust

This repository is a hands-on implementation of the "Writing an OS in Rust" blog series by Philipp Oppermann. The goal is to guide you through the process of building a simple operating system using the Rust programming language. Philipp Oppermann's blog provides detailed explanations and insights into each step, and this repository serves as a practical companion.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/download/)

### Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository to get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aliasharf123/blog_os.git
cd blog-os
```

### Building and Running

Follow the instructions provided in Philipp Oppermann's blog to build and run the operating system. Typically, you would use the following commands:

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple stages, corresponding to the blog series chapters. Each stage is represented by a separate branch in this repository. To navigate between stages, use the following git commands:

```bash
git checkout freestanding
```
